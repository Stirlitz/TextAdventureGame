Bedroom: You wake up in a strange bedroom, it's cold and wet. Water drips form the roof into a pail in the corner. The bed is a plain mattress, but no blanket is to be seen.
Hallway: You walk into the hallway, to the north, the bedroom, to the south, the living room of the house. The hallway leads outside the house to the east.
Living Room: It's just a living room, it's dark and musty, a few rotting armchairs lay in it, and several bookshelves line the wall. The only exit is the one you entered through.

Outside: You walk to the front of the house, you can see clearly that is is a small, rundown farm house. You can either walk into the house to the west, or continue along the road east.

Forest Spring: You enter a clearing with a large rocky fixture in the center, spring water bubbles up from somewhere in the rocks, and creates a small pool around it. The trees are too dense to go anywhere but from where you came.
-
Outside: You walk along the path until you reach the crest of the hill. To the west, you can see the farmhouse far in the distance. To the east you see a field that stretches as far as you can see.
Behind House: You walk around to the back of the house, there is nothing of interest here at all, *Trust me*.

Shortcut
HellHole: You walk through the cave untill you happen upon a large opening. It's a dead end, but you walk in anyways, you take one step into the cave, and the ground opens up, hot air blasts up!
-
Cliff: You walk up to the cliff, there doesn't seem to be much here, perhaps you should consider going back from whence you came?
-
Shubbery Zone: You walk into a forest clearing, the trees are sparse, but the ground is arranged into a strange, but neat shubbery arrangement. It does seem like you can continue to the west.
-
East Field: The field continues in all directions as far as the eye can see, but you can see a strange arrangement of stones to the east

Cottage Living Room: The living room is strange, it looks exactly like the one in the farmhouse, but this one isn't run down. The only exits is the entrance, and the closet to the south.
-
Cave 3: After continuing along the tunnel for a while, you end up at a 90 degree turn, and the cave continues westward.
Cave 2: It's a cave, use your imagination, a think there might be a side tunnel to the east, but the tunnel continues onward.
Cave 1: It's a cave, only not really, because your outside, and you can move in any cardinal direction.
Cave 0: You enter the dark, spooky, wet, uncomfatable, chilly, moist, creepy, cold damp cave. The tunnel only goes in one direction, north.
